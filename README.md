## Use

```bash
Usage of cgen:
  -bump string
        #bumps the {major | minor | patch | pre-release string} version of the current directory using git tags.
  -install string
        #install a generator using a git clone compatable url cgen -install <url>
  -list
        #lists all installed generators
  -name string
        #what would you like to name your new project
  -tmpl string
        #specify a which template you would like to use.
  -upgrade
        #attempts to update the current directory, if it's already a cgen project
  -version
        #prints cgen version number
```

### Bumping a projects version

This utility function works on any git repository, not just one created using cgen.  Since most projects generate with cgen will use git, we found it helpful to include this features.

### Installing a template

cgen :heart_eyes: plugins, but it does not use package managment, instead you can just reference any git repository that you have access to.

```bash
cgen -install https://github.com/techdecaf/cgen-template
```

### Upgrading an existing Template

## Creating Your own Template Plugin

You can actually use `cgen` to create a `cgen` template :tada:

> NOTE: make sure you have the cgen template generator installed as shown above, then...

```bash
cgen -tmpl cgen-template
```

We use the go template engine to create your project, you can find detailed documentation here:

You can also take a look at the [cgen-template](https://github.com/techdecaf/cgen-template) project for more information on use.

- [Go Template Documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/)
- [todo: link to examples](/examples)

```go
// {{.Name}} project was generated by robots at
// {{ .Timestamp }}
// using data from
// {{ .URL }}
{{- range .MyArray }}
    {{ printf "%q" . }},
{{- end }}
```

### Template Operators Operators

- eq - Returns the boolean truth of arg1 == arg2
- ne - Returns the boolean truth of arg1 != arg2
- lt - Returns the boolean truth of arg1 < arg2
- le - Returns the boolean truth of arg1 <= arg2
- gt - Returns the boolean truth of arg1 > arg2
- ge - Returns the boolean truth of arg1 >= arg2

## Updating a template

cgen creates an answer file in the root of your project, if you wish to upgrade your project with a newer version of your installed template just `cd <project_dir>` and `cgn  -upgrade`.

## Bumping a project version

Wait, what? Why does a generator do this?

we added a bump feature to cgen to help with your projects life cycle, frequently we end up using many different tools to change the version of a project depending on the language we are using.  However we felt that git was the correct place to bump and release new versions of our code.  So you can also use cgen to handle this for you.

To use run `cgen -bump <major | minor | patch | pre-release string>` and cgen will update your git tags with a new semver.
